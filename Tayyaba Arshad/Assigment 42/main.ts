//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

//define a magician name in a array
let magicianName : string[]= ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "David Batine"]

//write a function to show_magician name
function show_magicians(magicians: string[]) {
    magicians.forEach(names => {
        console.log(names);
        
    });
    
}

//function to make a magician great through for loop method
function make_great(magician: string[]) {
    for (let i  =  0; i < magician.length; i++) {
         magicianName[i] = " The Great " +  magician[i] ;
        
    }
}

//call the function
make_great(magicianName)

show_magicians(magicianName);
